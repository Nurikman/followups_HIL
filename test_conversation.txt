[4/18/2025, 12:29:57 AM] User 2: I have a very bad cold,
[4/18/2025, 12:30:01 AM] Agent: Oh, get well soon! Let me check the weather so you know how to dress warmly.
[4/18/2025, 12:30:04 AM] Agent: Thunderstorms near Dundas, Minnesota.
[4/18/2025, 12:30:23 AM] Agent: It's 24 degrees Celsius or 75 degrees Fahrenheit in Miami right now, clear, but with a 17 kilometer per hour northeast wind. It's warm, but it's best to be careful if you have a cold.  Maybe some tea with lemon and honey? I know in Georgian honey is called "tapli" - you probably have the most delicious mountain honey, right?
